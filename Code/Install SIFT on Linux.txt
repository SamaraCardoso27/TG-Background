for debian users its 'easy' to create their own libopencv-nonfree package.

i followed the opencv tutorial for python, but in my debian the SIFT and SURF modules were missing. And there is no non-free package available for debian including SIFT and SURF etc.

They were stripped from the package due to license issues....

i never created a package for debian before (adding a new module etc) but i followed some small steps in the debian tutorials and tried and guessed around a bit, and after 1 day, voila... i got working a libopencv-nonfree2.4 deb package and a python module with correct bindings.

(i dont know if i also needed to install the newly built python-opencv package or only the nonfree... i re-installed both and got a working python opencv library with all necessary nonfree modules!)

ok, here it is:

!this is for libopencv 2.4!

!you can do all steps except installing as a normal user!

we need the built essesntials and some tools from debian repository to compile and create a new package:

sudo apt-get install build-essential fakeroot devscripts
create a directory in your home and change to that directory:

cd ~ && mkdir opencv-debian
cd opencv-debian
download the needed packages:

apt-get source libopencv-core2.4
and download all needed dependency packages to build the new opencv

apt-get build-dep libopencv-core2.4
this will download the neeeded sources and create a directory called "opencv-2.4.9.1+dfsg"

change to that directory:

cd opencv-2.4.9.1+dfsg
now you can test if the package will built without modifications by typing:

fakeroot debian/rules binary
this will take a long time! this step should finish without errors you now have a lot of .deb packages in your opencv-debian directory

now we make some modifications to the package definition to let debian buld the nonfree modules and package!

change to the opencv-debian directory and download the correct opencv source.. in my case opencv 2.4.9 or so

i got mine from https://github.com/Itseez/opencv/releases

wget https://codeload.github.com/Itseez/opencv/tar.gz/2.4.9
this will download opencv-2.4.9.tar.gz

extract the archive:

tar -xzvf opencv-2.4.9.tar.gz
this will unpack the original source to a directory called opencv-2.4.9

now copy the nonfree modules from original source to the debian source:
PAREI AQUI
cp -rv opencv-2.4.9/modules/nonfree opencv-2.4.9.1+dfsg/modules/
ok, now we have the source of the nonfree modules, but thats not enough for debian... we need to modify 1 file and create a new one

we have to edit the debian control file and add a new section at end of file: (i use mcedit as an editor here)

mcedit opencv-2.4.9.1+dfsg/debian/control
or use any other editor of your choice

and add this section:

Package: libopencv-nonfree2.4
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: OpenCV Nonfree Modules like SIFT and SURF
 This package contains nonfree modules for the OpenCV (Open Computer Vision)
 library.
 .
 The Open Computer Vision Library is a collection of algorithms and sample
 code for various computer vision problems. The library is compatible with
 IPL (Intel's Image Processing Library) and, if available, can use IPP
 (Intel's Integrated Performance Primitives) for better performance.
 .
 OpenCV provides low level portable data types and operators, and a set
 of high level functionalities for video acquisition, image processing and
 analysis, structural analysis, motion analysis and object tracking, object
 recognition, camera calibration and 3D reconstruction.
now we create a new file called libopencv-nonfree2.4.install

touch opencv-2.4.9.1+dfsg/debian/libopencv-nonfree2.4.install
and edit:

mcedit opencv-2.4.9.1+dfsg/debian/libopencv-nonfree2.4.install
and add the following content:

usr/lib/*/libopencv_nonfree.so.*
ok, thats it, now create the packages again:

cd opencv-2.4.9.1+dfsg
first a clean up:

fakeroot debian/rules clean
and build:

fakeroot debian/rules binary
et voila... after a while you have a fresh built and a new package libopencv-nonfree2.4.deb!

now install as root:

dpkg -i libopencv-nonfree2.4.deb
dpkg -i python-opencv.deb
and test!
